# 🧠 N-Queens Problem Solver

This project solves the classic **N-Queens problem** using backtracking. The goal is to place `N` queens on an `N x N` chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Place `N` queens on an `N x N` chessboard such that:
- No two queens share the same row
- No two queens share the same column
- No two queens share the same diagonal

---

## 📈 Time Complexity

The solution uses **backtracking**, with a time complexity of approximately **O(N!)** in the worst case.

---

## 🛠️ Languages & Tools

- Python 3.x (or any other language you've implemented it in)
- Basic understanding of recursion and backtracking

---

## 🚀 How to Run

### Using Python:

```bash
python nqueens.py
